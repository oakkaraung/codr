# Codr READ ME

Welcome to Codr! This program is the result of a 2 week long development phase for the final project of the UCSD Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp. All four of our developers have put in many hours into this website and we hope that you enjoy its usage as much as we enjoyed creating this product.

Codr is a website that allows users to easily design and create a website using our templates and instead of paying a monthly fee or such like other user-friendly website designer websites, gives the user the source code for the website the user designed. This allows the user freedom to do many things such as deploying the website with a domain the user purchased, or even allowing new web developers to understand what goes on in a basic website. The outputted source code comes with a number of commented code which explains to the user what each component in the source code does what in the finished product. This website appeals to many from those who simply want a simple website without paying an outside company fees to do so, to new web devs looking to have a finished product to modify and see the inner workings of the code.

## Getting Started

Codr requires users to sign up for an account to prevent robot users from spamming our services (sorry Robocop). The first step to the user's new website is to simply sign up for an account to gain access to our multiple templates.

## Using The Templates

Once the user has selected his/her desired website, they are presented with a website that is very similar to their final product, a.k.a. the template. The template's main purpose is to provide the user with a website full of text input fields that is already formatted, styled, and stocked with pictures that leaves the user with creative freedom to change the text on the website to match their desired outcome. All text inputs are editable, including the copyright footer at the bottom of each website (NOTE: To actually copyright your website, visit [The US Copyright Website](https://www.copyright.gov/)).

## After The Download

After designing their website, the user then downloads the actual HTML file for their designed website and is taken to a page with instructions on how to do a simple deploy of the website onto The World Wide Web through Google Drive. Alternatively, the user may take their new website file and host it on a domain that they have purchased. Instructions to do so can be found [here](https://www.business.qld.gov.au/starting-business/internet-start-ups/online-basics/creating-websites).
