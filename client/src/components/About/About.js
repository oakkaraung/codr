                <p>Codr is a free web application that provides its users with templates that they can simply click on and modify many aspects of. Once users finish editing a template, they are given the option to download an HTML file which will display the website that the users were editing earlier. This file may then be personally used by the user linked to a domain as their own website.</p>

                <p>Trevor can be described as a creative mind. He enjoys long walks on the beach, video games, and coding. But he is usually behind a computer or another black mirror so he doesnâ€™t make it to the beach very often. He enjoys being close to a body of water.  Trevor grew up in Lake Tahoe and moved to San Diego to attend San Diego State University. After graduating, he worked for two years as a freelance photographer. From there, he began to learn how to code. He is currently looking for a job as a programmer.</p>
