                <p>Trevor can be described as a creative mind. He enjoys long walks on the beach, video games, and coding. But he is usually behind a computer or another black mirror so he doesnâ€™t make it to the beach very often. He enjoys being close to a body of water.  Trevor grew up in Lake Tahoe and moved to San Diego to attend San Diego State University. After graduating, he worked for two years as a freelance photographer. From there, he began to learn how to code. He is currently looking for a job as a programmer.</p>
